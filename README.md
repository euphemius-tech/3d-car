# 3D Car Visualization

## Overview

Welcome to the 3D Car Visualization project! This interactive web application utilizes Three.js to render a realistic 3D model of a car. It's designed to showcase the detailed features of the car model in a dynamic, browser-based environment. This project is ideal for educational purposes, automotive design showcases, or as a foundation for more complex 3D visualization projects.

## Features

- Realistic 3D car model rendering.
- Interactive controls to explore different views and details of the car.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Integration of advanced Three.js features like lighting, textures, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm
- A modern web browser that supports WebGL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shliamin/JS-3D-Car.git
   cd JS-3D-Car
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To get the 3D Car Visualization up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   Open a terminal at the project root and run the following command to start the Webpack development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command compiles the application and hosts it on a local server. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:8080

### Usage

The 3D Car Visualization application provides interactive features that allow you to explore the 3D model extensively:

- **Rotate**: Click and drag your mouse across the screen to rotate the view of the car.
- **Zoom**: Use your mouse wheel or pinch gestures on touch devices to zoom in and out.
- **Model Interaction**: Various UI controls may be available to change parts of the car, switch materials, or toggle additional visual effects.
